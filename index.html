        <h1>R Clay Wright</h1>
	<p>I am fascinated by how complex, dynamic gene networks determine cell fate and how robustness, plasticity, and evolution of these networks are linked across cells, tissues, and organisms.</p>
        <p>As a chemical engineer with expertise in protein engineering, synthetic biology, bioinformatics, and plant biology, my research is focused on the development and implementation of quantitative tools to interrogate the signaling networks central to plant growth and development.</p>
