I finally put together a personal site to document my research and open source tool development! 
It is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), so I can use Markdown to author my posts and 
render Rmarkdown documents as github_pages to quickly share examples and analyses. 

It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be, 
following [Jonathan McGlone's guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).
